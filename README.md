* This project is by no means complete! new features can be added, I'll provide some of the changes that I or even YOU can make! the following can be implemented:
1. Allow the user to control the pressure, density or even temperature instead of the altitude
2. Add more units & conversions
3. Further increase the range if possible
4. Improve the performance
5. Make it look prettier
6. Get creative!

3. Make some commits to improve the project
4. Push this branch to your GitHub project
5. Open a Pull Request on GitHub
